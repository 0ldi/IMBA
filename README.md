# Detailed description
This is an addon trying to achieve the third generation of information supplied by boss mods. All options can be set via the options window which can be accessed via `/imba`. Windows if hidden will pop up on the start of a boss fight so you can position and close them. 

For the Addons Friendly Neighbor and Tank Finder they have slash commands for targeting a unit in a macro. For Friendly Neighbor its `/targetfn #` where # is the position on the list and the same for Tank Finder except its `/targettf #`. For either of the commands to work the player needs to have the corresponding window open.

Credits
A Function for parsing strings is taken from AIOI
The Templates for enabling & disabling mods is from CTRA (I really liked that setup so figure I would borrow it)
Thanks to MRNaxxramas addon for the basis of the charge detection on Thaddius and the quick confirmation of a few events for a few boss encounters (my own personal old CTRA Boss addons over used events lets say)
Template for the timer bars is based off the template from SWStats
Thanks to Transcriptor for easing my logging of events for AQ40 (I wish I had known of this for Naxx :-p)
